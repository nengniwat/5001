### Data Source : Burapha University Language Institute
#### A questionnaire was created and then distributed to a sample of first-year university students of a Thai public university. The questionnaire was used to collect student English proficiency data by gender and skills in listening and reading.

### Why was a bar chart used to present the data?
#### I visualized the data using a bar chart because it can simply show the differences of listening and reading scores between male and female students. This would make readers better understand the data.
